# FinDocAI - Deployment Guide

## Vercel Deployment

Your project has been successfully configured for Vercel deployment with the following optimizations:

### Configuration Changes Made:

1. **Simplified Next.js Configuration**: Removed complex webpack configurations that were causing stack overflow issues during build trace collection.

2. **Optimized Build Scripts**: 
   - `postinstall`: Automatically generates Prisma client
   - `vercel-build`: Custom build command for Vercel

3. **Lazy Loading**: All AI services (Groq) are lazy-loaded to prevent build-time API key requirements.

4. **Dynamic Routes**: All API routes are marked as `force-dynamic` to prevent static generation conflicts.

### Required Environment Variables:

Make sure to set these in your Vercel dashboard:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-production-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.vercel.app"
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloudinary-cloud-name"
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
```

### Deployment Status:

✅ Local build working  
✅ Prisma integration configured  
✅ AI services lazy-loaded  
✅ Dynamic routes configured  
✅ Configuration simplified  
✅ GitHub integration ready  

### Manual Deployment:

If automatic deployment doesn't work, you can deploy manually:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Troubleshooting:

1. **Stack Overflow Error**: Resolved by simplifying Next.js configuration
2. **Prisma Issues**: Resolved with proper build scripts
3. **API Key Errors**: Resolved with lazy loading pattern
4. **Dynamic Route Issues**: Resolved with force-dynamic exports

Your application should now deploy successfully on Vercel!

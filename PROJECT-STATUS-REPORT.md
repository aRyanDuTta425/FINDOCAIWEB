# FinDocAI Project Status Report 

## Project Overview
FinDocAI is a full-stack financial document intelligence platform that uses OCR and AI to extract and analyze information from financial documents. The system includes authentication, file uploads, OCR processing, AI analysis, and a modern user interface.

## System Components

### üü¢ Fully Implemented
- **Authentication System**: Complete JWT-based authentication with signup, login, logout, and profile endpoints
- **File Upload**: Secure file upload to Cloudinary with validation and error handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, successful migrations and schema implementation
- **UI Components**: Modern responsive interface with Tailwind CSS

### üü° Partially Implemented
- **OCR Processing**: OCR functionality works in the browser with Tesseract.js, but uses a stub implementation on the server
- **Document Analysis**: Successfully integrates with Google Gemini AI API for analysis, but with limited financial document templates
- **API Endpoints**: Most endpoints working, but individual document fetch has routing issues

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented
- **Batch Processing**: Need to optimize and fully test batch processing of multiple documents
- **Advanced Analytics**: Additional financial data extraction and visualization features
- **User Management**: Admin dashboard for user management and document oversight
- **Export Functionality**: Export extracted data in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)

## Testing Results

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Authentication | ‚úÖ | Successful signup, login, and token verification |
| File Upload | ‚úÖ | Images successfully uploaded to Cloudinary |
| OCR Processing | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Functional with browser-side processing, server-side stub implemented |
| AI Analysis | ‚úÖ | Successfully analyzes documents and extracts information |
| Document List | ‚úÖ | Successfully retrieves all documents for a user |
| Single Document View | ‚ùå | 404 error on individual document retrieval |

## Technical Issues Resolved
1. Fixed OCR module to work around WebAssembly limitations in Next.js
2. Configured Next.js to handle WebAssembly with webpack customization
3. Implemented dynamic imports for Tesseract.js to avoid server-side loading issues
4. Fixed TypeScript typing issues throughout the codebase
5. Corrected PostCSS configuration warnings

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Fix the single document retrieval API endpoint and UI component
2. Enhance server-side OCR capabilities (consider serverless function)
3. Expand financial document templates for better Gemini AI analysis

### Medium-term Goals
1. Implement batch processing optimization
2. Add user dashboard with document analytics
3. Improve error handling and fallback mechanisms for OCR/AI failures

### Long-term Vision
1. Train custom AI models for specific financial document types
2. Add collaborative features for team document analysis
3. Implement data extraction API for integration with accounting systems

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure `.env` file with:
   - Database connection string
   - Cloudinary credentials
   - JWT secret
   - Gemini AI API key
4. Run database migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## API Documentation
- POST `/api/auth/signup`: Register new user
- POST `/api/auth/login`: Authenticate user
- GET `/api/auth/me`: Get current user profile
- POST `/api/upload`: Upload new document
- POST `/api/ocr`: Process document with OCR
- POST `/api/analyze`: Analyze document with AI
- GET `/api/documents`: List all user documents
- GET `/api/documents/:id`: Get specific document with OCR and analysis data

## Conclusion
The FinDocAI system has a solid foundation with working authentication, file upload, and basic OCR/analysis functionality. The remaining issues are primarily related to server-side OCR processing and individual document retrieval, which can be addressed with the suggested next steps.
